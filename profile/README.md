# CCS229-CS3A-2024-25: Intelligent Systems Course Repository

Welcome to the **CCS229BSCS3A-202425** GitHub organization! This platform serves as the central repository for **Intelligent Systems**, a course offered to BSCS 3A students for the academic year 2024-2025. The repository will be used to host example code, collaborative projects, and learning materials while leveraging GitHub Education tools.

## ðŸ“˜ Course Overview

The **Intelligent Systems** course provides an in-depth exploration of Artificial Intelligence (AI) and its various subfields, focusing on theoretical foundations, practical implementations, and emerging trends. Key topics include:

- **Machine Learning (ML)** â€“ Supervised, unsupervised, and reinforcement learning techniques  
- **Artificial Intelligence (AI)** â€“ Fundamentals, history, and modern applications  
- **Generative AI** â€“ AI-driven content creation, large language models (LLMs), and diffusion models  
- **Deep Learning** â€“ Neural networks, CNNs, RNNs, and transformers  

Students will gain hands-on experience by implementing algorithms, experimenting with AI frameworks, and developing projects that demonstrate real-world applications.

## ðŸ“‚ Repository Structure

The organization will host multiple repositories related to different aspects of the course:

- `examples/` â€“ Sample implementations and demonstrations of AI/ML concepts  
- `projects/` â€“ Group and individual projects showcasing AI applications  
- `assignments/` â€“ Coursework and coding exercises  
- `datasets/` â€“ Datasets used for machine learning tasks  
- `resources/` â€“ Reference materials, papers, and supplementary readings
